### CPSC 120

* Lab 3 [https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-03-ChaitanyaTalluri23.git]

    Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite because before this lab I was struggling in the class. I was finding it hard to understand all the information that was being thrown at me. This lab was different though. It was a turning point in the semester for me. I finally started understanding the various functions and things we were learning such as "cout" and "cin".

* Lab 7 [https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-chaitanya-and-bryan.git]
    Lab 7, part 1 was also another favorite because I struggled a lot during this lab. I found it very difficult to figure out the parameters for the "DateDifference" functions. In the end though, I figured it out and it felt very satisfying knowing I was able to figure it out.

* Lab 12 [https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-chaitanya-lucia.git]
    Lab 12 as a whole was my personal favorite because everything was clicking that day. My partner and I were able to complete the lab in under a hour without any mistakes. It felt very good knowing after an entire semester I could actually complete the lab without running into any major problems.
